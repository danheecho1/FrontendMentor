## Built with

## What I learned

- For centering items, using 'display: table' and 'display: table-cell' is also  one of the preferred options. I used flexbox with 'justify-content: center' and 'align-items: center'. I am still not sure if 'table' and 'table-cell' is better than flexbox. 

- Moving forward, I will consider giving semantic tags class attributes. While semantic tags are somewhat self-defined, I think giving them class/id attributes can help with writing more descriptive/undestandable codes (especially when looking at HTML and CSS together).
